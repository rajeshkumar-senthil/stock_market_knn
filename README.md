# Stock Market Price Prediction Using KNN

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock market prices using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- yfinance

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical stock price data from sources like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize the data if necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create relevant features such as moving averages, price differences, and other technical indicators.
4. **Model Training**: Use the KNN algorithm to train your model on the historical data.
5. **Prediction**: Predict future stock prices based on the trained model.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-price-prediction-knn.git
